# Python
Python Practice

Modules in this repository were created based on an introductory to Python course

FYI:

1) 
Classes are created based on nouns
Methods/Functions are based on verbs

2) 
Methods and Functions are similar except that Methods are defined in a Class whereas Functions are defined independently
Also, Methods require the 'self' explicit parameter when it's defined in the Class to reference each instance

3)
Lists data structures are like Arrays in C
Dictionaries are like Structs in C
